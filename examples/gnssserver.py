gnssserver.py

This is a simple but fully-functional example of a TCP Socket
Server or NTRIP Server which reads the binary data stream from
a connected GNSS receiver and broadcasts the data to any
TCP socket or NTRIP client running on a local or remote
machine (assuming firewalls allow the hostip:port).

Press CTRL-C to stop the server.

The clients must be capable of parsing binary GNSS data.
Suitable clients include (but are not limited to):
1) pyubx2's gnssdump cli utility invoked thus:
   >>> gnssdump socket=hostip:50010
2) The PyGPSClient GUI application, invoked thus:
   >>> pygpsclient

To run in NTRIP Server mode, the receiver should be an
RTK-capable receiver (e.g. u-blox ZED-F9P) running in
"Base Station" mode (either SURVEY_IN or FIXED). The clients
must be NTRIP clients (e.g. PyGPSClient's NTRIP Client
facility). FYI it'll happily run in NTRIP mode with any data
stream but the data would be useless to an NTRIP client
if it's not proper RTCM3 RTK correction data.

The example essentially runs two (pseudo-)concurrent threads:
- an input thread based on the pyubx2cli.gnssdump.GNSSStreamer
  class from the pyubx2cli gnssdump utility, using a message
  Queue as an external protocol handler.
- an output thread based on the pygpsclient.socket_server
  SocketServer and ClientHandler classes,
  originally designed for the PyGPSClient GUI application.
  (a local copy of the classes is in /examples/socket_server.py
  for those that don't have PYGPSClient installed)
